Dwarfexample is a sample application which demonstrates how to extract specific debug information from executables created in the DWARF format. 
In this case one can print the summary statisics about the execution, unique source files in the binary, details of all source files and details of all functions.
Currently this tool supports only 32 bit DWARF executables and the configure script is supported only for Linux-86 and HP Itanium platform. 

This application uses a libdwarf open source (http://reality.sgiweb.org/davea/dwarf.html ) and this needs to be compiled in 32 bit to the target platform. 
The libdwarf has to be downloaded to the path <DwarfExample>.

To build dwarfexample, type
        ./configure ( This will generate the Makefile)
        make

To run dwarfexample,
  ./dwarfexample -f func_name [-musl] input_binary_filename 
func_name is any function name which you want to check in the binary. You will get the function name by looking at the sample application code.

-m Dump Summary statistics.
-u Dump Unique Source Files.
-s Dump All Source file details
-l Dump All function details

input_binary_filename - is the DWARF 32 bit executable filename 
You can use the example stack_tracing.c which is a sample program , that can be used to test the dwarfexample.
